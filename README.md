# Summary
Repository for the 1st project for Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree on Udacity.

In this project we train an agent to collect bananas in the Unity based environment.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. The agent has 4 possible actions - move forward, move backward, turn left, and turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

# Contents

Contains the agent code (`dqn_agent.py`), neural net code (`model.py`), training notebook (`Navigation.ipynb`), trained model weights (`checkpoint.pth`), and report (`Report.pdf`).

# Instructions

Follow the instructions in `Navigation.ipynb` to train the agent.
